# Introduction
OTT platforms have been some of the most revolutionary services that received a huge attention and users with the rise of internet. The un-matched flexibility provided by the OTT platforms ensured that they became very popular in very less time, hence, the scale, which is good from a business PoV, but, is a rather difficult task when looked at from a engineering PoV, became a critical thing to handle. Thus making sure that right components are used in the right manner are critical to ensuring the scalabilty in service offerings. 

One of the main components to achieve the scale efficiently as mentioned above are the algorithms that are used to design these services/functionalities. At the core, any code that is implementing a certain business logic like streaming, analytics, payments etc. are all well-defined algorithms. Thus it is extremely critical that right algorithms and data structures as they are the core of any tech-business service.

In this portfolio, we take a deeper look at how algorithms play an important role in smooth functioning of an OTT service.

# Functionalities
1. **Adaptive bitrate streaming**
    
    - ABR refers to the process of making streaming available in multiple video/audio resolutions to choose from and optionally, switching between multiple resolutions based on the user's available bandwidth.
    - **Data structure**: Data structures like [queues](https://github.com/amoghdodawad/aps-portfolio/blob/main/codes/queues.cpp) can be used for buffering, etc.
    - **Algorithms**: Few of the popular ABR algorithms/protocols are MPEG-DASH, HLS etc.

2. **Typeahead search**
    - Typeahead search refers to the functionality where the user types a part of the query he/she is intending to search and the potential list of completed queries is prompted back to the user to choose from.
    - **Data structure**: [Trie](https://github.com/amoghdodawad/aps-portfolio/blob/main/codes/trie.cpp) is a popular data structure to perform operations on dictionary like functionalities.
    - **Algorithms**: Trie can be used in conjuction with algorithms like [BFS](https://github.com/amoghdodawad/aps-portfolio/blob/main/codes/bfs.cpp), [DFS](https://github.com/amoghdodawad/aps-portfolio/blob/main/codes/dfs.cpp) to find the k-nearest words.

3. **Timestamps / Chapters**
    - Timestamps/chapters are the key-moments in a video where an important subject is being streamed. Allowing users to skip directly to the timestamps results in saving huge amount of bandwidth and time.
    - **Data structure**: Linear data structures like array, [queues](https://github.com/amoghdodawad/aps-portfolio/blob/main/codes/queues.cpp) would be used here.
    - **Algorithms**: Algorithms like [max-sum sliding-window](https://github.com/amoghdodawad/aps-portfolio/blob/main/codes/slidingWindow.cpp) would help in identifying the key moments in the video. Caching those results using data structures like hash-tables will greatly reduce the latency.

4. **Most-watched / Most-replayed**
    - This features enables users to look at the most viewed segments in a given video. This is a constantly changing parameter as the watch time of individual user keeps on changing as per their requirements over a range of time.
    - This is more useful to the content creator as they can retrospect on their content and watch-behaviour of their users.
    - **Data structure / Algorithm**: Data structures like [Fenwick trees](https://github.com/amoghdodawad/aps-portfolio/blob/main/codes/fenwickTree.cpp), [Segment trees](https://github.com/amoghdodawad/aps-portfolio/blob/main/codes/rangeUpdateQuery.cpp) can optimise the process of generating this analytics they are better suited for range updates.
5. **Personalised recommendation system**
    - This feature enables users to get recommendations based on their watch history and the preferences as suggested by the user himself/herself.
    - **Data structure / Algorithm**: Machine learning algorithms/techniques like deep learning, NLP etc. can be used to effectively generate the personalised feed for each user.
6. **Multi-parameter filtering**
    - This feature enables users to filter the content based on multiple parameters like genre, language, year etc.
    - **Data structure**: Data structures like [BST, B-trees](https://github.com/amoghdodawad/aps-portfolio/blob/main/codes/btree.cpp) help in effectively filtering the content.
    - **Algorithm**: Algorithms like [Union-find](https://github.com/amoghdodawad/aps-portfolio/blob/main/codes/unionFind.cpp) help in identifying the similar filters to ones provided by the user.
7. **Pagination**
    - This feature enables user to view top-k suggestions in their personalised feed at a time.
    - This is highly important for the server and the database as well, as querying and processing a large chunk of data is highly resource intensive.
    - **Data structure / Algorithm**: Data structures like [heaps](https://github.com/amoghdodawad/aps-portfolio/blob/main/codes/heapify.cpp) are highly efficient in sorting out of the top-k elements.
